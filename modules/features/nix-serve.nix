# Nix binary cache server using nix-serve behind nginx with HTTPS.
#
# Server-side only — import on the cache host (jehoel). Clients (raphael,
# uriel) get the substituter from nix-qol.nix and the public key only.
#
# The signing key pair must be generated before building. Run once:
#
#   nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key cache.otwell.dev \
#     /tmp/cache-private-key.pem /tmp/cache-public-key.pem
#
# The private key lives in supersecrets.yaml under "nix-serve-private-key".
#
# Alternatives if nix-serve proves insufficient:
#   - nix-serve-ng: drop-in Haskell replacement, faster
#   - Attic: feature-rich (dedup, GC, token auth, multi-tenant, S3-backed)
#   - Harmonia: Rust-based, fast, simple
#
# The cache host does NOT list cache.otwell.dev among its own substituters —
# nix-qol.nix skips it when services.nix-serve.enable is true. Its store
# already backs the cache, so querying itself is pure overhead and a local
# nginx/ACME hiccup would become a nix failure mode on the build host.
# Other substituters (cache.numtide.com via pi.nix) are unaffected.
