# eBay Marketplace Account Deletion endpoint.
#
# Gates the production keyset: eBay won't activate production API keys
# until a "Marketplace Account Deletion/Closure Notifications" endpoint
# passes challenge validation (GDPR-style third-party data deletion
# compliance — see the personal-resale skill for context).
#
# GET  /ebay-deletion?challenge_code=X
#   -> 200 {"challengeResponse": sha256hex(challenge_code + token + endpoint_url)}
#      (concatenation order and the exact URL string are binding)
# POST /ebay-deletion  -> 200, payload+signature logged to the journal
#      (ack fast, review later; for a self-use app the only data
#      subject is the seller themselves)
#
# Same vhost pattern as taskdog/silverbullet: nginx + ACME in front,
# plain-http service behind. uriel is the natural host (nginx already
# runs there; jehoel ssh.otwell.dev pattern is for SSH, not HTTP).
#
# DNS: deletion.otwell.dev needs a record (Porkbun) pointing at uriel's
# public IP BEFORE first deploy — ACME needs it for the cert.
