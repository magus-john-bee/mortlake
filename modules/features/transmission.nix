# Transmission — torrent client with done scripts that act on completed
# torrents from allowed trackers. Tracker patterns come from sops (not
# hardcoded) so the repo can stay public and which trackers qualify is
# not recorded anywhere in git.
#  - share trackers   → copy into the Syncthing share directory
#  - library trackers → symlink (file or top-level dir) into the Jellyfin
#                        library; the download stays in transmission's dir.
# Transmission only supports a single script-torrent-done-filename, so one
# dispatcher invokes both handlers; each skips quietly when its tracker
# doesn't match or its action is already done.
