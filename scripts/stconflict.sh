# stconflict — find and resolve Syncthing .sync-conflict files interactively.
#
# Usage:
#   stconflict [directory]          # interactive resolution (default: .)
#   stconflict [directory] --kill   # delete all conflict files, keep originals
#   stconflict [directory] --list   # just list conflicts, no action
#
# Requires: delta (for diffs), fzf (optional, for file selection).
